st.write("""
The system uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) to generate unpredictable, unique ticket numbers, introducing immense complexity for prediction. 
Tickets are produced by a random number generator combined with unique machine IDs to guarantee fairness.

Security Strength:
Approximate resistance of 99.999% against pattern recognition due to random number generation, advanced cryptographic techniques, and anonymization protocols.

Human Crack Time:
Given the immense randomness in generated tickets, manual cracking would take centuries or even millennia to break down through statistical analysis.

Resource-Assisted Crack Time (Supercomputers):
Even with supercomputing power, the ticket's secure, multi-layered cryptographic hash renders breaking the system infeasible for a span of decades or more.

Additional Details on Security:
With the integration of historical data, adaptive complexity ensures that each draw improves security by adapting to previous draw patterns, making it exceedingly hard to predict future draws.

Security Innovations:
- High resilience against brute-force attacks, where even supercomputers will need decades to crack patterns.
- Random ticket generation with layered cryptographic protocols ensures fairness and unpredictability.
- Multi-factor cryptographic security integrated for each ticket issuance process.
